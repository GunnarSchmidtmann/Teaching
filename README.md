# Teaching
This repository contains two demos to understand simple data processing and plotting in Matlab and Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn) (including histogram and Gaussian fit).
This repository also contains a dataset of shoe sizes of 90 subjects (Male: N=32; Female: N=58).
I will update this database on a regular basis.
